- title: Machine learning inference in Cats Effect
  description:
    We want to make it possible to deploy machine learning inference as part of a larger web service without compromising the latency of other on-going requests. The goal of this project is to create a compiler to transform a pre-trained ML model into a sequence of Cats Effect `IO` steps that perform inference on some input.
  prereqs: Scala, ideally some experience with ML
  difficulty: Hard but doable. Will draw on knowledge of ML and compilers.

- title: Serverless integrations for Feral
  description:
    Feral is a Typelevel library for building serverless functions that currently supports AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Run Functions. We want to support more cloud providers, such as Cloudflare Workers.
  prereqs: Scala, interest in Functional Programming, ideally experience with serverless
  difficulty: Medium.

- title: Native I/O backend for FS2 JVM
  description:
    FS2 on the JVM currently implements its networking API using JDK NIO. Unfortunately this indirection incurs a non-trivial performance penalty. We want to replace the use of JDK NIO with direct calls to system I/O APIs such as `epoll` and `kqueue`.
  prereqs: Scala, ability to read C
  difficulty: Medium.
  length: long

- title: "Streaming implementation of an XQuery subset"
  description: "XQuery allows for transforming XML data in a declarative way. Based on the generic streaming query engine added into the [fs2-data](https://fs2-data.gnieh.org) library, write a frontend to implement a streamable subset of XQuery."
  prereqs: Scala, ideally some experience with XQuery
  difficulty: Hard.

- title: "Enhancements for the cross-platform otel4s tracing module"
  description: "A GSoC 2023 project prototyped a cross-platform implementation of the Open Telemetry tracing specification. We are exploring options to further enhance and address missing features in this implementation."
  prereqs: Scala, interest in Functional Programming
  difficulty: Medium. 
  length: medium
